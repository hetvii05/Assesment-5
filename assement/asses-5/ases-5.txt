1. Creating the Tables

First, we will create the Bank, Loan, and Account_holder tables.

sql
CREATE TABLE Bank (
    branch_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_name VARCHAR(100),
    branch_city VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Loan (
    loan_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    branch_id INT,
    account_holder_id INT,
    loan_amount DECIMAL(15, 2),
    loan_type VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (branch_id) REFERENCES Bank(branch_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (account_holder_id) REFERENCES Account_holder(account_holder_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Account_holder (
    account_holder_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    account_no VARCHAR(50),
    account_holder_name VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    contact VARCHAR(15),
    date_of_account_created DATE,
    account_status VARCHAR(20),
    account_type VARCHAR(50),
    balance DECIMAL(15, 2)
);


2. Intra-Bank Transfer Transaction

Assuming we have accounts A and B with their account numbers and the amount to transfer is $100.

sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct $100 from account A
UPDATE Account_holder
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_no = 'Account_A';

-- Add $100 to account B
UPDATE Account_holder
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_no = 'Account_B';

-- Check if balances are not negative (optional safety check)
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Account_holder
    WHERE (account_no = 'Account_A' AND balance < 0)
       OR (account_no = 'Account_B' AND balance < 0)
)
BEGIN
    ROLLBACK;
    PRINT 'Transaction failed due to insufficient funds.';
END
ELSE
BEGIN
    COMMIT;
    PRINT 'Transaction successful.';
END;


3. Fetch Account Holders from the Same City

sql
SELECT *
FROM Account_holder a1
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Account_holder a2
    WHERE a2.city = a1.city
      AND a2.account_holder_id <> a1.account_holder_id
);


4. Fetch Accounts Created After the 15th of Any Month

sql
SELECT account_no, account_holder_name
FROM Account_holder
WHERE DAY(date_of_account_created) > 15;

 5. Display City Name and Count of Branches in that City

sql
SELECT branch_city, COUNT(branch_id) AS Count_Branch
FROM Bank
GROUP BY branch_city;
6. Display Account Holders with Loans
sql
SELECT ah.account_holder_id, ah.account_holder_name, l.branch_id, l.loan_amount
FROM Account_holder ah
JOIN Loan l ON ah.account_holder_id = l.account_holder_id;
